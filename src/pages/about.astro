        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>Hey there! I’m Maciej, but you can also call me Maxie—just a nickname inspired by a character from Pokémon whose style I liked as a kid. I’m a programmer who not only codes for a living but also for fun. For me, programming is both a passion and a creative playground.</p>

        <h2>What I Do</h2>

        <p>I’m not your average developer. While many might tie themselves to a specific language or framework, I’m all about problem-solving. Sure, I’ve worked in dozens of programming languages and even dabbled in creating my own, but at the end of the day, I don’t define myself as a "programmer in language X." My focus is on understanding problems and finding the best ways to solve them.</p>

        <h2>My Story</h2>

        <p><strong>Where It All Began:</strong> It started with Ruby and RPG Maker XP back in primary school. I spent hours experimenting with game mechanics and scripting. A few years later, I got into C++ and PHP, crafting my own MVC frameworks just for the fun of it. Fast-forward to today, and my fascination with technology hasn’t faded—if anything, it’s grown stronger.</p>

        <p><strong>The Journey Over the Destination:</strong> I enjoy exploring solutions, learning new tools, and experimenting with ideas more than finalizing projects. While many developers focus on polishing the end product, I’m more interested in the path to getting there. This blog is a place where I share those journeys—my experiments, discoveries, and the thought processes behind them.</p>

        <h2>My Philosophy</h2>

        <p>Programming, in my view, often strays into <strong>coding for the sake of coding</strong>, losing sight of the real goal. I believe a program is just a tool—it exists to perform a task and solve a problem. People, on the other hand, are driven by curiosity and the need to understand. That’s where I shine: using my innate need for knowledge and exploration to tackle problems and uncover solutions.</p>

        <h2>Languages and Tools</h2>

        <p>Most people in this section describe their favorite programming languages in which they are looking for work. I find this to make little sense.</p>

        <p>I’ve worked with dozens of languages and even created some of my own, but the ones that stand out to me are <strong>Rust, Ruby, PHP, TypeScript, and Haxe</strong>. Each has its quirks and strengths, and they’ve all helped me express ideas in unique ways.</p>

        <p>For me, coding isn’t about the language—it’s about what you can create with it.</p>

        <h2>Let’s Work Together</h2>

        <p>If you’re here looking for someone to bring your project to life, I’d love to help. Whether it’s building something from scratch, tackling a challenging problem, or experimenting with cutting-edge technologies, I’m open to <strong>freelance opportunities</strong>. Let’s talk and see what we can create together!</p>
